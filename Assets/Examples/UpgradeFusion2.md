OnChanged now gets only the behaviour and not the Changed<> wrapper - how to get old values?

What does 
public void RegisterAttachableInstance(NetworkRunner runner, NetworkObject obj)
do?

Use NetworkSceneManagerSimple as base for custom scene manager

Add Fusion.Unity to weaver assembly list

Had to chance spawn during scene load to "Queued" for some reason (??)

OnChanged no longer called on state authority, need to explicitly call handlers

Player IDs are no longer in the [0;maxplayers[ range
