To use the ORNavigation system do the following:

1. Assign one of the available paths to a GameObject (In the ORNavigation folder)
2. Assign the ORNavigation behaviour to a GameObject
3. Set the target property to the Transform object you pretend to animate.
4. Optionally change the Look Mode to define where the target will be looking at during the navigation.

Hit play!
